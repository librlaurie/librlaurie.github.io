## Hello

I became a librarian very shortly after I finished college in 1999 (right around when Google started). Since 2002 when I moved home to Philly, I've worked at Penn or Haverford in departments of reference, research and instruction, and, more recently, digital scholarship. Over the last few years, my career has intersected and been heavily influenced by some of the work that is called Digital Humanities. I have also taken on greater leadership roles. For both of those reasons, it makes sense for me to have a website. That said, part of the reason that I love being a librarian is because I get to learn and be creative and thoughtful without having to write very much. So, this site is very much an experiment for me, and is usually kind of out of date... Thanks for visiting.

### About me (aka, my brief bio)
Laurie Allen is the Director for Digital Scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. She and her colleagues collaborate on new forms of scholarship to support campus-wide open access publishing, data curation & management, digital humanities, and mapping and geospatial data efforts. A native Philadelphian, she also serves as Research Director for [Monument Lab](http://monumentlab.com/), a public art and civic research project in Philadelphia. In late 2016, Allen and colleagues in the Penn Libraries helped start [Data Refuge](http://www.datarefuge.org) by teaming up with the Penn Program in Environmental Humanities in an effort to help protect copies of federal environmental and climate data.  Before joining the Penn Libraries, Laurie was the Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Research at Haverford College. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Bard College, and a Master's of Library and Information Science from Simmons College.


### About the header image
The image at the top of these pages is from the Philadelphia City Planning Commission Northwest District Plan of 1966. The full plan (and map) are available on the [Philadelphia Neighborhoods Plans](http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/pages%20/index.cfm?so_id=5923) website. Re-doing that site is something that I've wanted to do since it was created in the mid-2000s. I find the plans there incredibly fascinating and scary and sad and strange. The interface, however, does not do them justice in 2016. So, we're working on a new one now that I'm back at the Penn Libraries.
