### About me (aka, my brief bio)
I am Laurie Allen and this is my personal website. It is almost always out of date. I work as a program analyst at the Library of Congress in the Office of Digital Strategy.

I am from Philadelphia, and I love my home city. Alongside my work at The Library of Congress, I also serves as Research Director for [Monument Lab](http://monumentlab.com/), a public art and history studio based in Philadelphia.

Before joining the Library of Congress, I was the the Director for Digital Scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania LibrariesPenn Libraries, and before that, I was the Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Research at Haverford College. I have a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Bard College, and a Master's of Library and Information Science from Simmons College.
