### About me (aka, my brief bio)
I am Laurie Allen and this is my website. It is almost always out of date. I work as the Director for Digital Scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. Generally, in my work I collaborate on new forms of scholarship to support open access publishing, data curation & management, digital humanities, and mapping and geospatial data efforts.

I am from Philadelphia, and I love my home city. Alongside my work at Penn Libraries, I also serves as Research Director for [Monument Lab](http://monumentlab.com/), a public art and civic research project in Philadelphia.

I got a lot of attention in early 2017 for the part I played in forming [Data Refuge](http://www.datarefuge.org). Together with colleagues, I teamed up with the Penn Program in Environmental Humanities in an effort to help protect copies of federal environmental and climate data.  

Before joining the Penn Libraries, I was the Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Research at Haverford College. I have a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Bard College, and a Master's of Library and Information Science from Simmons College.
